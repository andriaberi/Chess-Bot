# Overview

ChessBot is a modular engine written in C#. It supports all chess rules, evaluates board states, and searches for optimal moves using iterative deepening with alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables.

It’s fast, accurate, and easy to expand.

# Features

* Fully legal move generation (castling, en passant, promotion)
* Bitboard architecture for high performance
* Magic bitboards for sliding pieces (rooks, bishops, queens)
* Iterative deepening alpha-beta with move ordering
* Transposition tables to reuse prior calculations
* Parallel time management for smooth gameplay
* Clean, modular codebase—UI-agnostic

# Architecture

| Component            | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Board`              | Manages game state using Zobrist hashing                         |
| `MoveGenerator`      | Generates legal and pseudo-legal moves using bitboards           |
| `MagicNumbers`       | Precomputed constants for fast sliding piece move calculation    |
| `Bot`                | Implements search algorithms, time management, and move decisions|
| `Evaluation`         | Performs static position evaluation with piece-square tables     |
| `TranspositionTable` | Caches positions for faster repeated state lookups               |
| `OpeningBook`        | Database of grandmaster openings to guide early-game decisions   |
| `UI`                 | Visualizes the board and user interface (specific to this app)   |


# Setup Instructions

1. **Make Sure .NET SDK is Installed**  
   - You need **.NET 6.0 or higher**  
   - Download it from: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)  
   - After installing, verify the installation with:  
     ```bash
     dotnet --version
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndriaBeridze/Chess-Bot.git
   cd Chess-Bot
   ```

3. **Run the Bot (Console Demo)**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Optional: Run the Move Generation Tests**
   ```bash
   dotnet run test
   ```

# Testing Guide

* After running the program, a window will open with the board set up—human plays as White by default.
* Drag and drop pieces to make your move.
* The bot will respond automatically, typically within 2 seconds.
* Monitor the timer to see the remaining time for each side.
* The game status (win/draw) will be displayed on the left once the game ends.
* Use the three buttons at the bottom-left corner to switch game modes: Play as White, Play as Black, or AI vs AI.
* To verify move generation correctness, run the tests with the command: `dotnet run test`

# Modifying the Codebase

* To change the bot’s behavior, navigate to the `Chess/Scripts/Bot` folder.
* To work on move generation logic, go to `Chess/Scripts/Framework/Chess/Move Generation`.
* To modify the user interface, access `Chess/Scripts/Framework/App/UI`.
* For theme and general settings, check out `Chess/Scripts/Utilities`.
